## Development Setup

The app uses `concurrently` to run both the frontend and the backend together.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AWS-WSU/AWS-Student-Hub.git
cd AWS-Student-Hub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Root directory:**
```bash
# Navigate back to the root of the repository
cd ..
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Concurrently runs the appropriate scripts for both the frontend and the backend to get the site running. Under the hood, this is what `npm run dev` is doing:

```bash
concurrently "npm run dev --prefix frontend" "npm start --prefix backend" 
```

This should give you an output in your terminal that looks something like this:

### 4. Open the Site

Navigate to `localhost:5173` in any browser, and you'll see the website. Any changes you make to either the frontend or backend should update automatically without you needing to refresh the page.

## Contributing to a Bug Fix or Feature

Beginning to contribute is simple. By default, you cannot push any changes to the `master` branch, so you must first start your own branch by doing the following:

### Option 1: Using VSCode or Similar IDE

#### Step 1: Create a New Branch
1. Open the project through VSCode or similar IDE
2. In the bottom left, click on the "master" branch symbol

   <img width="491" alt="Branch selection in VSCode" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ffd0feb-37e8-4765-ab4f-891b9848b4dc" />

3. Select **"Create a new branch"**
4. Name your branch something descriptive like `feature/color-themes` or `fix/login-bug`

   <img width="595" alt="Create new branch dialog" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79669ab4-93ba-48e2-a0db-3787409827c5" />

#### Step 2: Develop Your Feature
1. Make your changes to the codebase
2. When ready to commit, click on the branch icon in your IDE

   <img width="217" alt="Branch icon in IDE" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c409b6e-7348-47c6-87a9-65598d2d8c2e" />

#### Step 3: Commit Your Changes
1. Stage your changes by clicking the commit button

   <img width="216" alt="Commit changes button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96970816-f5a2-43a0-b43e-2b252d312055" />

2. You will be asked if you want to stage all your changes - click **Yes**
3. Enter a descriptive commit message. For example:
   ```
   fix: refactored login component to accept saved login states
   ```

   <img width="592" alt="Commit message dialog" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca35741a-8a9f-4f90-96e4-4d638207ed06" />

4. Click the checkmark on the top right (or similar in your IDE) to accept the commit message

#### Step 4: Push Your Changes
1. Click the "push changes" icon to upload your changes to GitHub

   <img width="218" alt="Push changes icon" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00650af-e9ba-4afc-90e7-6b581ac552bd" />

#### Step 5: Create a Pull Request
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. You should see a notification like this - click to open your pull request for review by one of the project leads

   <img width="960" alt="Pull request notification" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e929ee-7430-4608-9001-8351b7d9678d" />

### Option 2: Using Terminal

If you are comfortable with the terminal, making changes and pushing them to git is straightforward:

#### Step 1: Make Your Changes
Simply make your changes using any IDE of your choice.

#### Step 2: Stage and Commit
Open a terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and execute the following commands in order:

1. **Stage your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   # or for specific files:
   git add <the-file-you-want-to-commit>
   ```

2. **Commit with a descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message goes here about what your changes do"
   ```

3. **Push your changes to your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request
Repeat Step 5 from the VSCode instructions above.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

If you run into issues getting the app up and running, here are some common problems and their solutions:

### ‚ùå Permission denied (publickey) when cloning the repo

**Cause:** You don't have your SSH key linked to your GitHub account, or no SSH key is set up on your device.

**Solution:**

1. **Check for existing SSH key:**
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   Look for files like `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`.

2. **Generate a new SSH key (if none exists):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:**
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Copy and add the key to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   
   # Windows/Linux - manually copy the output
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   
   Then go to [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and add your key.

### ‚ùå npm install fails or throws errors

**Common causes:**
- Using an outdated version of Node.js
- Missing build tools (especially on Windows)
- Cache issues

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure Node.js is installed:**
   - Install [Node.js from the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - Check your Node version: `node -v`
   - Use **Node v18+** (consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions):
     ```bash
     nvm install 18
     nvm use 18
     ```

2. **Clear the npm cache:**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Remove node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

4. **On Windows (for node-gyp errors):**
   ```bash
   npm install --global windows-build-tools
   ```

### ‚ùå Port already in use (e.g., EADDRINUSE :5173)

**Solution:**
Kill the process using the port, or use a different port:

```bash
# macOS/Linux:
lsof -i :5173
kill -9 <PID>

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### ‚ùå Frontend not auto-refreshing on changes

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're running the app via `npm run dev` from the root directory
- Try restarting the Vite server (`Ctrl + C` and then `npm run dev` again)
- Make sure your file changes are inside the `frontend/src` directory and not outside the watched paths
